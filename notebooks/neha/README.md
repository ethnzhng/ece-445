This week I have been responsible for fleshing out the problem, solution, high level requirements, subsystem requirements, tolerace analysis, and ethics of  our proposal and design document. This included finalizing and calculating the temperature threshold we will be utilizing for this project which was determined to be 13.0-14.0 degrees Celsius. This satisfies both the requirement of needing the water in the pipe to be above 55 degrees which is what is considered the ideal temperature for households to maintain to prevent frozen pipe burts and the requirement of accounting for the +/- 0.5 degrees Celsius tolerance of the digital thermometer.

Today we visited the machine shop and talked to Greg to drop off our tub and solenoid valve that came in last week. During the initial discussion 2 weeks ago he had proposed using plastic tubing but today he suggested that a PVC pipe would be more suitable to accomodate the plastic water solenoid valve we will be using. This is ideal as a PVC pipe was part of our original proposal as that is what is used in many residences/buildings in the real-world. We also discussed choosing the height at which the opening of the pipe would be off the floor and decided upon 4 inches. 

In addition, visited the electronic services shop to pick up some of the resistors and capacitors that will be required for our PCB.

I also fulfilled placing the order for the rest of the parts that will be required for the completion of this project.
