While searching for parts, we discovered the Raspberry Pi we needed was sold out. As an alternative, we contacted the professor 
and TA of ECE 479 and received a Raspberry Pi 4 kit. 

Ordered some parts that we needed for the project.
        parts ordered: 12VDC solenoid valve, DS18B20 temperature sensor probe, 128x64 oled display.
        (May switch to 16x2 LCD display as it's easier to connect to atmega328p)

Spoke to the machine shop for initial build ideas. 
        Will provide tub and valve when it arrives for the build of our encasement.

Started working on the PCB schematic.
        As of now, PCB will consist of atmega328p, LCD display and FTDI module for USB communication.
        potential questions: 
                - How to connect the FTDI module to the atmega328p(is it even necessary?)
                - How to connect the relay to the atmega328p and the solenoid valve

Post TA meeting: 
    Feedback included adding more tolerance analysis and bounds to proposal and design document.
